# Espresso shot logger

Instrumentation for an Ascaso Dream PID + Eureka Mignon Single Dose.
Currently **Phase 0: logging only.**

---

## Hard invariants

Violating any of these is a bug, not a design choice.

1. **Phase 0 never actuates anything.** No writes to any machine signal.
   Every tap is high-impedance or passive. Read-only.
2. **Never write flash during a shot.** An ESP32 flash write blocks for
   tens of ms, which stalls the BLE stack and puts gaps in the curve.
   Buffer in RAM, write once when the pump stops.
3. **Store raw sensor values, never derived ones.** Flowmeter pulses, not
   millilitres. The ml/pulse factor is calibrated and will be revised;
   baking it in makes old shots uninterpretable.
4. **Weights are integer milligrams.** Bookoo reports to 0.01 g, so mg is
   lossless and repeated arithmetic never drifts.
5. **Grind settings are meaningless without their epoch.** A setting is
   relative to a zero point that moves whenever the burrs come out.
   Never compare or fit across `grind_epoch` boundaries.
6. **Never lose a shot.** Spool to flash, upload, delete only on
   confirmed success.

## Hardware facts (verified, do not re-derive)

### Machine: Ascaso Dream PID

Control board MCU is an **STM32F030R8T6** (LQFP64, 64 KB flash). Read off
the physical chip marking. Note: the community schematic repo
(`techdregs/Ascaso_Dream_PID_Electronics`) bundles the *wrong* datasheet —
`stm32f030f4.pdf` is the 20-pin TSSOP variant. Use the F030x8 datasheet
and RM0360.

Pin map, from the traced schematic:

| Net | Pin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1Cup | PB5 | up direction of the switch, 15 s clean cycle |
| 2Cup | PB6 | down direction, 60 s shot |
| Water | PB4 | present on board, likely unwired on a Dream |
| Steam | PA10 | as above |
| DIP1–4 | PB0–PB3 | four config DIP switches (SW1), purpose unknown |
| Flow-P1 / P2 | PA8 / PA9 | flowmeter, conditioned to 3.3 V logic |
| AC_Sense | PA5 | mains zero-cross, via opto U27 |
| Pump_Ctrl | PA15 | → FODM3053 → BTA204S triac (random-phase) |
| Solenoid_CTRL | PB12 | |
| HTR_CTRL | PB15 | |
| display link | PB7/PB8 or PB8/PB9 | see below |

**Switch electrical:** +5 V → R45 (100 R) → switch common. Pressing pulls
the line **high**; idle is low. 5 V logic, *not* mains. The 5 V rail comes
from an IRM-03-5 isolated module, so sharing ground with the ESP32 is safe
provided the ESP32 runs from an isolated supply.

**Switch semantics — important.** The switch is an SCI R13-29, momentary
ON-OFF-ON, spring return to centre. The board *latches*:

- short pulse → start the stored timer, or stop a running shot
- **hold > ~2 s → reprograms that direction's timer to the hold duration**

Consequences: there is no way to stop the machine by opening the switch
line, so no fail-safe-open design is possible on that path. And any future
actuator that can hold the line will silently reprogram the machine. Phase 1
must use a hardware one-shot (74HC123 or NE555, ~120 ms) so firmware can
*trigger* but never *hold*.

**Display bus — DECODED 2026-09-28 (0b done).** Captures and the decoder
are in the repo: `analysis/captures/2026-09-28-display-bus-*.sr`,
`tools/decode-display-bus.py`. Read those before touching this again.

Probe at **J5** on the main control board, 4 pins. **The connector is
JST XH** — verified 2026-09-28 against the JST datasheet by measurement,
not by eye:

| Role | Part |
|---|---|
| Plug housing (on the machine harness) | `XHP-4` |
| Crimp contact | `SXH-001T-P0.6` (AWG 28–22) |
| Board header, top entry | `B4B-XH-A` |

Measured 12.3 mm wide across the latches (spec 12.3; EHR-4 is 12.0),
5.5 mm thick (spec 5.7; EH is 3.8 — the decisive one), pin span ~8 mm
(spec 7.5). Friction latch with ribs, which EH does not have.

**Sellers list these as "XH2.54". That is a misnomer — XH is 2.5 mm.**
The listings are the right part; anything actually specified as Molex
2.54 is not equivalent.

Sellers also print **"JST EH"** in spec tables for parts that are plainly
XH — seen 2026-09-30 on a LiPo balance extension whose own title said XH.
What the part is *for* is better evidence than what the listing calls it:
hobby LiPo balance ports are XH in all but a few outliers. **That
particular lead is believed XH but has NOT been mated to J5 yet** — this
paragraph is the reasoning, not a measurement. Verify by mating, not by
reading, and do not promote this to a fact until something has seated.

**Every connector on this board is XH**, including J2 (`BOTONE`, 5 pins →
`XHP-5` / `B5B-XH-A`) and J4 (flowmeter, 3 pins → `XHP-3` / `B3B-XH-A`).

**The headers are moulded `H JST`, and that marking does NOT mean EH.**
JST moulds it on XH headers too — it appears in the XH header drawing but
not in any extractable text, so a text search of the datasheet will tell
you the opposite. EH headers carry no such marking. The moulded number is
the circuit count, so `3 H JST` is a `B3B-XH-A`.

If a connector on this machine ever needs re-identifying, the one
measurement that separates XH from EH — they share pitch, pin span and
width to within 0.3 mm — is **depth**: plug 5.7 vs 3.8 mm, header shroud
5.75 vs 3.8 mm. Nothing else discriminates, which is why identifying this
from photographs failed repeatedly.

Its pinout, from the traced schematic in
`techdregs/Ascaso_Dream_PID_Electronics`:

| J5 pin | Net | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | VSS | ground — the pad with thermal-relief spokes into the copper pour |
| 2 | `ESD1` | signal, via U26. One of the two we decode. |
| 3 | `ESD4` | signal, via U26 and R24. The other one. |

**Which of `ESD1`/`ESD4` is the clock was never written down.** The 0b
captures name their channels `D0`–`D7` with no record of which probe sat
on which pad, and the decoder just takes CSV column 0 as clock. Next time
the analyser is on the bus, settle it and replace this paragraph: the
clock is the metronome — uniform ~9.9 kHz, 36 µs high, 65.5 µs low — while
the data line tracks the displayed number. A wrong guess is electrically
harmless (identical dividers on both legs) but decodes nothing, so if a
built tap is silent, swap the pair before suspecting anything else.
| 4 | `Disp-P4` | third signal — **bidirectional**, see below. Idle high; never moved in 3 s of capture. |

**There is no +5 V on J5** — it is ground plus three signals. A constant-high
line on a logic analyser looks exactly like a supply rail, which is how it
got mislabelled first time round.

**`Disp-P4` is bidirectional — never drive it.** It reaches the MCU (net
`P16`) through a two-transistor pair: `P16` → R30 (100 R) → Q11
(PDTC143ET) → R31 (2.2 K) → Q10 → R32 (100 K) → the pin. One transistor
lets the MCU pull the line low, the other lets it sense the line being
pulled low from the display end. That topology only exists when both ends
talk on one wire.

**Working hypothesis (untested):** the display module carries two buttons
and reports them on this line — `ESD1`/`ESD4` are the MCU driving the
display, `Disp-P4` is the display answering. If true it is worth logging,
because those buttons set the PID temperature and a setpoint change is
exactly the event that silently invalidates an 0f noise-floor run.
**To test:** capture while pressing each display button; a simple level, a
serial burst, or nothing are all informative.

This is the one J5 line where a careless connection could actuate the
machine, which hard invariant 1 forbids. The 8.2 K / 15 K divider is
high-impedance and receive-only, so it is safe as specified — but do not
replace it with anything that can source current.

Two traps, both of which cost time on 2026-09-28:
- **Ground is pin 1, the spoked pad.** The square-pad-is-pin-1 convention
  does NOT hold on this board, and the wire colours say nothing either (the
  harness is red/black/red/black because it was cut from two 2-wire reels,
  and ground lands on a red one). Trust the thermal relief into the pour.
- Both decoded signals idle high on the 4.7 K pull-ups, as the schematic
  predicted.

It is **not I²C.** Plain synchronous serial: clock ~9.9 kHz (high 36 µs,
low 65.5 µs), data sampled on the **rising** edge and stable across a whole
clock period. Frames repeat every ~41 ms in two lengths, 133 and 67 bits,
separated by >1 ms of clock idle; only the 133-bit frames carry digits.
Beware: sigrok's `i2c` decoder happily "decodes" this as endless writes to
address 0x00 — that output is the symptom of a wrong guess, not a result.

Three 7-segment digit fields, MSB = segment a, order abcdefg:

| Field | Bits in the 133-bit frame |
|---|---|
| hundreds / leading (blank when idle) | `[106:113]` |
| tens | `[115:122]` |
| units | `[124:131]` |

**Idle: the display shows boiler temperature in °C.** During a brew the
machine takes the display over for a **shot timer in tenths of a second**
(counts `001`→`169` for a 16.9 s pull), so temperature is *not* readable
mid-shot. That timer is a gift though: it is the machine's own pump-on to
pump-off measurement, which is exactly the signal 0c switch sensing was
meant to provide.

### Scales: 2 × Bookoo Themis (BLE)

Pair **both**: one under the cup, one for the grinder. That makes
`dose_in_g` and `dose_ground_g` self-logging, which is the difference
between a logger still in use in six months and one abandoned in week
three.

- `esp-arduino-ble-scales` lists Bookoo Themis as tested — use it rather
  than writing the protocol
- Bookoo publish their protocol at `github.com/BooKooCode/OpenSource`
- The scale sleeps after ~15 min idle. Reconnect logic is mandatory.
- Timestamp samples on arrival with `millis()`. Don't trust device clocks.

### Board: ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 clone, N16R8

16 MB quad flash + 8 MB octal PSRAM. Three consequences:

- PlatformIO needs `memory_type = qio_opi`. Getting this wrong boot-loops.
- **GPIO35/36/37 are unavailable** (octal PSRAM uses them internally).
- **Partition table entries must stay below 0x800000.** The die is genuinely
  16 MB (esptool reads/writes distinct data above 8 MB, no address wrap), but
  any partition beyond 8 MB makes this clone's Macronix chip boot-loop
  silently (RTC_SW_SYS_RST before any output) on arduino-espressif32 2.0.17.
  Bisected empirically 2026-08-27; only the first 8 MB is usable by firmware.

PSRAM is unused by this workload. It's present because that's the cheap
commodity module, not because we need it.

## Architecture (decided — don't relitigate)

```
Bookoo ×2 ──BLE──► ESP32-S3 ──WebSocket──► Go service ──► SQLite
switch sense ─────►  (buffer   (live)          │
flowmeter ────────►   in RAM)                  ├─► serves PWA
                            ──HTTP POST──►     └─► MQTT summary ──► HA
                              (shot complete)
```

**The tablet only ever talks to the Go service.** Web Bluetooth does not
exist on iPadOS in any browser, and a sleeping tablet must never be able
to lose a shot. The ESP32 owns the radio and the timing.

**HTTP POST, not MQTT, for shot upload in Phase 0.** Simpler, curl-able,
and the flash spool already handles retries. MQTT arrives in Phase 1 when
there's a command path to carry.

**Home Assistant consumes, never stores.** Publish 4–5 summary entities
over MQTT discovery for glanceable status and notifications. HA's
entity-plus-recorder model cannot represent a shot object with a 350-point
curve and foreign keys to beans and grind epochs; the relational structure
is the whole value.

**Go for the service, Python for the analysis, SQLite as the interface.**
Go: single static binary, frontend via `embed.FS`, `modernc.org/sqlite`
(no CGO). Python/Jupyter reads the same file for variance work, model
fitting and later Bayesian optimisation. Neither needs to know about the
other.

Deployment target: one Debian LXC on Proxmox, 512 MB RAM. No Postgres, no
Redis, no k3s. Single-user database, ~50 MB after several years.

## Phase 0 milestones

**0a — scale logging.** BLE, shot detection, spool, upload, UI. No machine
contact. Most of the work, none of the risk. *This is where to start.*

**0b — display bus.** Logic analyser on J5, offline reverse engineering.
Parallel track, no code yet.

**0c — switch sensing.** **150 K / 220 K** divider on PB5 and PB6 into GPIO
(5 V → 2.97 V, 13.5 µA load — an optocoupler's mA would drop ~1 V across
the 1 K series network and could break the board's own threshold). Do NOT
use 220 K / 220 K: 2.50 V against an ESP32-S3 VIH of 2.475 V leaves 25 mV
of margin, which supply tolerance alone consumes, and a pressed button
would read as not pressed. The switch harness is **J2** (silkscreen
`BOTONE`), 5 pins: +5 V, Steam, 1Cup, 2Cup, Water. Gives real shot
boundaries, flush events, and a true `first_drip_ms`.

**0d — flowmeter.** Tap PA8/PA9 (already 3.3 V logic) through 1 K series,
count on interrupt. Calibrate by weighing water on a Bookoo. Log both nets
— possibly quadrature, possibly two-meter support.

**0e — temperature**, only if 0b succeeded.

**0f — sit still.** 30 shots changing nothing, then compute the standard
deviation of shot time and mean flow. That number is the noise floor, the
Phase 3 deadband, and the honest go/no-go on closed-loop control. Do not
skip this to get to the fun part.

**MEASURED 2026-09-28** (`analysis/0f-noise-floor.ipynb`, n=46):
**σ = 0.21 g/s on mean flow (12.2 %)**, σ = 3.43 s on shot time (14.2 %).
Stratify before trusting any re-run — one bean, one grind epoch, one
`detector_version`; pooling detector versions inflates σ for no physical
reason. The figure bundles puck prep with the machine, so it is an upper
bound on what control could fix, not a machine spec.

---

## Weighing attribution

The workflow weighs **once**, after grinding — freezer doses are
pre-portioned, so there is no pre-grind weighing. `dose_ground_g` is
measured; `dose_in_g` is usually `bean.portion_target_g`, and
`shot.dose_source` records which.

**Never ask the UI to declare intent before a weighing.** No "arm dose
capture" button. Every required tap before coffee is a tax paid while
holding a portafilter, and it is how logging habits die.

Instead, record every stable reading as an anonymous `weighing` row and
attribute it **retroactively** when a shot closes:

> the last unattributed weighing before this shot started is its dose

Stable event definition:

```
|dw/dt| < 0.05 g/s sustained >= 1.5 s
  AND weight > 5 g
  AND no shot in progress
  AND within a plausibility window (12-24 g for a dose)
```

Re-placing or nudging the cup yields several events — the last wins,
earlier ones stay with `superseded = 1`. Keep them: when a dose looks
wrong you want to see what the scale actually saw.

This works identically with one scale or two, so `role_hint` on a scale
is a hint and never a requirement. A flat battery must degrade the data,
not break the workflow.

**Show the inferred dose on the capture screen with a stepper to correct
it.** Not a required input — a correctable default. That's how you get
zero-friction and correctness at once. User corrections set
`attributed_by = 'user'`.

---

## Shot detection (0a, scale only)

State machine `IDLE → ARMED → POURING → SETTLING → DONE`:

- **ARMED** — weight within ±0.5 g of zero and stable for 1 s (i.e. tared
  with the cup on)
- **POURING** — `dw/dt > 0.3 g/s` sustained 300 ms. Backdate `t=0` to the
  crossing.
- **stop** — `dw/dt < 0.1 g/s` for 1.5 s. `stop_ms` = when it first
  dropped below.
- **SETTLING** — keep sampling 5 s more → `yield_final_g`.
  `settle_offset_g = final − at_stop`.
- **reject** — final yield < 5 g (a drip or a knock, not a shot)
- **fault** — weight drops > 5 g mid-pour (cup removed)

Flow rate: central difference over a 700 ms window. `mean_flow_gps` over
from 5 g out to 80 % of final, skipping the first-drop lag.

`first_drip_ms` is **null in 0a** — without switch sensing there's no
pump-start reference. It becomes real in 0c.

`settle_offset_g` matters more than it looks: today you stop the shot by
hand when the scale reads target, so the overshoot distribution *is* the
calibration data Phase 1 needs. Phase 0 measures it before any wire is cut.

---

## On-flash format

Packed binary, never JSON — same data as JSON is 20 KB instead of 3.5 KB
and slower to write.

```c
typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {
  uint16_t t_ms;         // offset from shot start
  int32_t  weight_mg;    // signed; tare drift goes negative
  uint16_t inlet_pulses; // cumulative
  int16_t  temp_dc;      // decidegrees C; INT16_MIN = no reading
} sample_t;              // 10 bytes
```

350 samples ≈ 3.5 KB per shot. One file per shot, header + samples.
Config (WiFi, endpoint, flow calibration, current bean, grind epoch) in
NVS, not the filesystem.
