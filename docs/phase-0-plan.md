# Phase 0 — build plan

Machine: Ascaso Dream PID (STM32F030R8T6 control board)
Grinder: Eureka Mignon Single Dose
Scales: 2 × Bookoo Themis (BLE)

**Goal of Phase 0:** log everything, actuate nothing. Ends with a few
hundred shots in a database and a measured answer to the only question
that decides whether Phase 3 is worth building — how much your shots
vary when you change nothing.

---

## Guiding rules

1. **Nothing in Phase 0 touches an output.** Every tap is high-impedance
   or passive. If a wire comes loose the machine behaves exactly as it
   does today.
2. **Electronics live outside the machine.** A small box behind or beside
   it, with a thin cable in. Inside is hot, damp and full of triacs.
3. **Photograph before touching.** DIP switch positions, connector
   orientations, wire colours, harness routing. You will want these.
4. **Each milestone is independently useful.** Stop at any point and you
   still have something working.
5. **Prefer reversible.** A Y-harness that plugs between the existing
   connector and the board beats soldering to pads.

## Milestones

### 0a — Scale logging (no machine contact at all)

The whole software stack, with zero hardware risk. This is most of the
work and none of the danger.

- ESP32 connects to a Bookoo as BLE central, samples at 10 Hz
- Detect shot start/end from weight rate of change
- Buffer the curve in RAM, write to flash on completion
- Publish to a server, write to SQLite using `schema.sql`
- Serve the web UI

**Second scale.** You have two. Pair both: one under the cup, one for
the grinder. Then `dose_in_g` and `dose_ground_g` log themselves and
the capture screen only ever asks you about taste. This is the single
biggest reason you'll still be logging in three months.

**Done when:** you log every shot for a week without thinking about it.

### 0b — Display bus reverse engineering (parallel, listen-only)

Independent investigation, no integration yet. Logic analyser on the
display connector **J5**, not on MCU pins — same signals, far easier to
probe, and it doesn't matter that we haven't identified the peripheral.

Two candidate lines, each with a 100 R series resistor and a 4.7 K
pull-up to +5 V, routed through the ESDA6V1SC6 array (U26) as nets
`ESD1` / `ESD4`. Either hardware I²C on PB8/PB9 or a bit-banged
two-wire link on PB7/PB8.

Capture while the machine heats up and while pulling a shot. You're
looking for a byte that tracks the displayed temperature.

**Done when:** you can predict the number on the display from the bus
capture. If the protocol turns out to be opaque, abandon it — cost was
€25 and an evening.

### 0c — Switch sensing

Real shot boundaries and flush events from the machine itself.

- **All four direction lines are tapped**, not two: there are TWO levers,
  A (1Cup up / 2Cup down) and B (Hot Water up / Steam down), sharing J2
  conductor 1 as their common. CLAUDE.md has the measured J2 pinout — note
  **2Cup sits before 1Cup** on the harness.
- Idle low, **high when pressed** (+5 V → R45 100 R → switch common),
  measured 2026-10-04.
- **The stored durations are not constants.** This machine's 1Cup is ~10.5 s,
  not the 15 s default, because it was reprogrammed by hand; 2Cup's stored
  value is unknown. An earlier version of these bullets quoted 15 s and 60 s
  as properties of the model. They are user-modifiable state.

Sense with a **resistor divider straight into an ESP32 GPIO**. Not an
optocoupler: an opto LED wants milliamps, and a milliamp through the
1 K series network is a 1 V drop that could break the board's own
threshold.

**Use 150 K / 220 K** — 5 V → 2.97 V at 13.5 µA. An earlier version of
this line said 100 K / 200 K, which is wrong twice over: it gives
5 × 200/300 = **3.33 V, above the ESP32's own 3.3 V rail**, which leaves
**zero headroom** and relies on both rails being exact. (30 mV over the
rail does not forward-bias a clamp diode — that needs ~0.3–0.7 V — so do
not repeat that mechanism; the objection is the missing margin.) CLAUDE.md has carried
150 K / 220 K for some time and this file was never updated — the same
stale-contradiction defect that put the pre-incident wiring in the
shopping list. CLAUDE.md is the source of truth.

Do **not** use 220 K / 220 K either: 2.50 V against an ESP32-S3 VIH of
2.475 V, and supply tolerance alone eats that margin.

Confirm the idle/pressed polarity with the multimeter before connecting
anything.

Share ground with the board's VSS. That's safe here — the 5 V rail
comes from an IRM-03-5, which is an isolated module — provided the
ESP32 also runs from an isolated supply (any USB phone charger).

**Firmware DONE (0.9.0, 2026-10-07); the tap is NOT yet built.** Four
polled, debounced lines, each press emitted with its backdated start and
duration, and a hold past 2 s flagged as a timer reprogram — which is the
machine rewriting its own configuration and the reason this machine's 1Cup
is ~10.5 s rather than 15 s with nothing recording when that happened.

**Note what the level does NOT mean.** Both levers are momentary with spring
return, and the board latches, so the line is high for the *press*, not for
the brew. Anything reading "shot in progress" off these pins is wrong.

**Done when:** flushes and shots appear in `machine_event` with correct
durations, and `first_drip_ms` becomes a real measurement. **Neither is true
yet** — the firmware reports presses on serial and over the live socket, and
nothing persists them. That is the remaining 0c work and it is deliberate:
persistence is not what gates the perfboard.

### 0d — Flowmeter

Inlet-side flow. Combined with outlet weight this is a direct read on
puck resistance — the nearest thing to a pressure profile without
plumbing in a transducer.

**Both paragraphs that used to be here were wrong, and were still here
after CLAUDE.md had corrected them** — the same stale-contradiction defect
flagged under 0c above. CLAUDE.md is the source of truth. For the record,
so nobody re-derives them:

- *"Tap the conditioned side (PA8/PA9), not the raw sensor at J4."* The tap
  is **at J4**, on the raw open-collector output, through a **100 K + 220 K**
  divider derived against the measured 9.4 kΩ node (120 K until 2026-10-08;
  100 K has about double the margin and is what is in stock). 1 K series is correct
  only on the *board* side of the board's own conditioning; at J4 it would
  feed a 4.69 V sensor output into a 3.3 V GPIO.
- *"Two nets — possibly quadrature, possibly two-meter support. Log both."*
  **J4 carries ONE signal** (ground + 5 V + `#`), measured 2026-10-04. The
  question is closed: neither.

**Read `docs/phase-0-status.md` before touching J4.** The 2026-10-03 tap
made the machine fault with `E01` mid-cycle — a hard invariant-1 violation.

**Firmware DONE (0.9.0, 2026-10-07); the tap is NOT yet refitted.** Falling
edges on GPIO6 into a ring, a 2 ms glitch floor, and a count windowed to the
shot so a hot-water draw cannot be attributed to a brew (the window opens at
pour confirmation — CLAUDE.md has the two gaps that leaves). Off by
default behind `flow on`; `selftest` drives a known pulse train from GPIO8
so the counting path is provable on the bench without the machine.

**Calibrate empirically** — run water into a jug on the Bookoo, count pulses,
divide. **DONE 2026-10-08: ~5900 pulses/L measured** over two weighed
flushes (both in `flowmeter_calibration`), which is 2.5× the ~2400 search
summary — that figure came from a datasheet nobody could retrieve and is now
folklore. The measurement is provisional until the analyser confirms the
counts are pulses rather than ringing; CLAUDE.md has the reasoning. Store raw pulses and the calibration separately
(`flowmeter_calibration`), never the converted millilitres.

### 0e — Integrate temperature

Only if 0b succeeded. **The deliverable changed once 0b revealed what the
display does during a brew**, and this entry used to describe something
that cannot be done from this source.

The machine takes the display over for its shot timer the moment the pump
runs, so there is **no boiler temperature to read mid-shot**:
`shot_sample.temp_dc` stays NULL for the pour by design, and
`008_machine_signals.sql` says so. The deliverable is therefore the
**pre-pour reading in `shot.boiler_temp_start_c`**, which is a per-shot
column rather than a per-sample one.

**Path DONE 2026-10-07** (shot 109). **What the number means is OPEN** —
see `docs/phase-0-status.md`: at the setpoint value the display cannot be
distinguished from the setpoint itself.

### 0f — Sit still and look at the data

**The most important milestone and the one that gets skipped.**

Pull 30 shots changing nothing. Same bean, same grind, same dose, same
prep. Then compute the standard deviation of shot time and mean flow
rate.

That number is your noise floor. It is the honest ceiling on what any
closed loop can achieve, and it sets the deadband in Phase 3. If it
turns out that your puck prep varies more than a 0.2 notch grind change
does, you have learned something worth more than the whole rest of the
project — and you'll know to spend your effort on prep consistency
rather than on a stepper motor.

## Parts

Prices approximate, EUR.

### Order now — milestone 0a

| Item | Notes | ~€ |
|---|---|---|
| ESP32-S3 dev board | Seeed XIAO ESP32S3 (tiny) or ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 (easier to probe) | 8–15 |
| USB-C cable + charger | probably already have | — |

That's it. 0a needs no soldering and no contact with the machine.

> **Superseded.** The parts tables below were written before the connectors
> were identified and before the multimeter broke. Use
> [`shopping-list.md`](shopping-list.md) for anything you are about to buy;
> these are kept for the reasoning behind each choice.

### Order with it — milestone 0b

| Item | Notes | ~€ |
|---|---|---|
| 8-channel logic analyser | FX2LP (CY7C68013A) clone, works with sigrok/PulseView | 10 |
| Micro test-hook grabber clips, ×10 | **do not skip** — you cannot hand-hold probes on a connector | 12 |

A €10 clone is genuinely fine for a 100 kHz two-wire bus. Don't buy a
Saleae for this.

### Order later — milestones 0c/0d

Identify the connector types on J2, J4 and J5 first (pitch and pin
count) so you can buy matching pigtails and build reversible Y-harnesses
instead of soldering to the board.

| Item | Notes | ~€ |
|---|---|---|
| Resistor kit, E12 1/4 W | dividers and series protection | 8 |
| 30 AWG silicone hookup wire, 4 colours | flexible, survives vibration | 8 |
| JST pigtails, assorted pitch | **after** identifying connectors | 8 |
| Perfboard + pin headers | 6 |
| Heat-shrink assortment | 5 |
| Small ABS project box | mounts outside the machine | 6 |

### Tools, if you don't have them

| Item | ~€ |
|---|---|
| Temperature-controlled soldering iron, fine tip | 40–60 |
| Flux pen + 0.5 mm solder | 12 |
| Headband magnifier | 15 |
| Multimeter | (you have one) |

### Deliberately not yet — Phase 1

74HC123 or NE555, optocoupler, RC parts for the one-shot.

Don't order these now. Phase 0f might change your mind about whether
brew-by-weight is even the right next step, and it would be a shame to
have the parts sitting there arguing with the data.

**Why the tablet only talks to the server:** Web Bluetooth doesn't exist
on iPadOS in any browser, and a tablet that falls asleep mid-shot must
never be able to lose a shot. The ESP32 owns the radio and the timing;
the tablet is a screen.

**Why MQTT:** 10 Hz of samples is nothing, you get fan-out for free, and
when Phase 1 arrives the command path is already there.

**Spool locally.** ESP32 writes each completed shot to flash and retries
the upload. Never lose a shot because the server was rebooting.

### Firmware

PlatformIO + Arduino framework. Not ESPHome — the YAML gets painful the
moment Phase 3's control logic shows up.

- `NimBLE-Arduino` for BLE
- `esp-arduino-ble-scales` — Bookoo Themis is listed as tested, so the
  protocol work is already done. Bookoo also publish their protocol at
  `github.com/BooKooCode/OpenSource` if you need to go deeper.

### Worth reading first

**GaggiMate** (`jniebuhr/gaggimate`) — ESP32, BLE scales, shot logging,
web UI, brew-by-weight. Read how it structures the scale abstraction
and the shot lifecycle before writing your own. You may decide to fork
it rather than start clean.

**Gaggiuino** — for the pressure/flow profiling side, relevant much later.

## First evening

1. Flash the ESP32, connect to one Bookoo, print weight to serial at 10 Hz.
2. Pull a shot with the ESP32 watching and the scale on the drip tray.
3. Paste the numbers into a plot.

If you can see the curve, everything else is software.
